## How to run

- Make sure you have node installed.
- Open the relevant file.
- Using VS Code, press `CTRL + ALT + N` or in your terminal, run `node filename`

Alternatively:

- Create an `index.html` file in the root of the project and link the relevant file in it
- Open browser and run file

> Anything `DOM` related is tested using `index.html` in the root directory. Don't confuse it with projects.

> The folders are named as per module and the files are named according to the lesson title.

# Projects

Projects done during this course are in the `./projects` directory.
